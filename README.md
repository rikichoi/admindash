# AdminDash
Admin Dashboard System - Providing Business Analytics and Content Management
### AdminDash: https://admindash-sooty.vercel.app/
### Example Business Website: https://nexagrid.vercel.app/

## Use case
The **purpose** of **AdminDash** is to provide an **accessible platform** in which businesses can **manage the content of their website** and **review business analytics**. Generally, this system will serve as a form of internal tooling for businesses that have an aspect of "payment" integrated into their business model, where **traditional Content Management Systems** such as **Wix** or **Shopify** cannot be used. An example use case would be for charity organisations like UNICEF that accept donations from individuals and companies. AdminDash enables oversight into the many transactions that take place within a system and allows report generation, automating tasks to reduce manual work and simplify the management process.

## Example Work-flow
1. Individual/Organisation navigates to business website (https://nexagrid.vercel.app/)
2. Makes a donation to a listed organisation or campaign
3. Payment is validated and documented via Stripe payment gateway
4. Transactions are recorded on the AdminDash system
5. Business can view analytics and manage content accordingly via AdminDash (https://admindash-sooty.vercel.app/)

## Additional/Optional Features
- [ ] Live Chat for internal communication between employees
- [ ] Automated Email Notification to admin upon successful donation
- [ ] Customizable Invoice generation feature
